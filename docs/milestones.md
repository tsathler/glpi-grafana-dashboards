# Milestone validation status

## Milestone 1 — Foundation

Scope: Grafana Compose service, environment configuration, datasource and dashboard provisioning, persistent data volume, static CI, and validation of the test environment foundation. No GLPI metric SQL is included before schema and version discovery.

Status: Complete

### Completed

- [x] Project structure.
- [x] Grafana Docker Compose service and persistent `grafana-data` volume configuration.
- [x] Provisioning configuration for the MySQL datasource and file-based dashboard provider.
- [x] Dashboard files and provider configuration managed in version control.
- [x] Environment-variable configuration with per-environment `.env` excluded from Git.
- [x] Static CI for `push` and `pull_request`, with only `contents: read` permission.
- [x] Development to GitHub to test promotion flow using `git push` and `git pull`; no manual file transfer.
- [x] Grafana runtime in the test environment: container running, HTTP service and web UI available on TCP/3000, and provisioning loaded.
- [x] MySQL plugin and provisioned **GLPI MySQL** datasource loaded (MySQL, `glpi`, proxy access, SELECT-only database account).
- [x] Datasource health check successful and datasource remains present after Grafana restart.
- [x] **GLPI Service Desk** dashboard provisioned, visible in Grafana, and still present after Grafana restart.
- [x] Expected provisioning and persistence behavior confirmed for the Milestone 1 foundation.
- [x] Direct MariaDB authentication and database access confirmed with read-only access.
- [x] Container host-network access to local MariaDB at `localhost:3306` confirmed.
- [x] MariaDB kept bound to localhost; firewall restricts Grafana TCP/3000 to trusted networks and MariaDB TCP/3306 is not exposed.
- [x] Project documentation aligned with implemented architecture and validation boundaries.
- [x] Repository secrets review completed; see [security.md](security.md).

### Static validation

CI runs Compose configuration, dashboard JSON, YAML and Markdown parsing/linting, Git whitespace checks, and checks that `.env` is not tracked and `.env.example` exists. It does not access the test environment, MariaDB, or GLPI, run real queries, use environment credentials, or deploy. A CI workflow being configured is distinct from a successful hosted workflow run; record hosted results separately. See [development.md](development.md).

### Runtime / integration validation

The dashboard intentionally contains no functional metrics or queries in this milestone. Its empty state is expected and does not indicate a Milestone 1 failure: it validates the Grafana foundation, provisioning, datasource connectivity, runtime, and persistence only.

### Deferred to Database Discovery and subsequent milestones

Metric and query work depends on Database Discovery. The installed GLPI version and actual schema must be verified before writing metric SQL. Later milestones will implement queries and validate results against GLPI, documenting mappings, filters, and limitations. These activities have not started as part of Milestone 1. Do not modify the GLPI database, schema, or application.
